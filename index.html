      <h1>
        Can You Survive A 
        <span>NIGHT ?</span>
      </h1>
      <div>
        <p>Congratulations and welcome to the premiere season of Stripped, a celebrity reality game show. Your goal is to survive a night at the mansion. Pretty simple right? Except that you all enter the mansion naked hips down.  Don't worry you don't have to see each other naked. Just not yet. The show begins at midnight when the mansion is totally dark. Try to grab an underwear while beating the odds of getting stripped by others or the mansion itself. You gain or lose fans for your actions. The one who exits the mansion with the highest number of fans wins.  Or you could stay inside the mansion until daybreak for more fun. The game is yours. 
          </p>

<span>Oh and I forgot to warn you. There are some bizarre underwear scattered across the mansion. Make sure to wear an appropriate one or you'll be humiliated. </span>

<p>Good luck!! Game on.</p>
