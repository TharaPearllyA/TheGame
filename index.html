		<h1>
			Can You Survive A
			<span>NIGHT ?</span>
		</h1>
		<div>
			<p>Congratulations and welcome to the premiere season of Stripped, a celebrity reality game show. Your goal
				is to survive a night at the mansion. Pretty simple right? Except that you all enter the mansion naked
				hips down. Don't worry you don't have to see each other naked. Just not yet. The show begins at midnight
				when the mansion is totally dark. Try to grab an underwear while beating the odds of getting stripped by
				others or the mansion itself. You gain or lose fans for your actions. The one who exits the mansion with
				the highest number of fans wins. Or you could stay inside the mansion until daybreak for more fun. The
				game is yours.
			</p>

			<span>Oh and I forgot to warn you. There are some bizarre underwear scattered across the mansion. Make sure to wear an appropriate one or you'll be humiliated. </span>

			<p>Good luck!! Game on.</p>

			It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
			looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
			letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many
			desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
			search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved
			over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)
